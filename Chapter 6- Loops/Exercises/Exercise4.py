'''Make a list called sandwich_orders and fill it with the names of various sandwiches. Then make an empty list called finished_sandwiches.
Loop through the list of sandwich orders and print a message for each order, such as I made your tuna sandwich. As each sandwich is made,
move it to the list of finished sandwiches. After all the sandwiches have been made, print a message listing each sandwich that was made.'''
